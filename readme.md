Based on your requirements, here's a high-level approach to developing a script or application that can manage your file system metadata:
1. Inventory Creation: Use a script to traverse through your file system and generate an inventory of your files. In Python, you can use the os module's os.walk() function to traverse directories [14]. To exclude certain directories, you can check the directory name and skip it if it matches your exclusion criteria [32].
2. Metadata Extraction: For each file, extract the required metadata. In Python, you can use the os.stat() function to get metadata like file size, modification time, etc [14]. For more advanced metadata, you might need to use additional libraries or tools [37].
3. Data Processing: Process the collected data according to your needs. This could involve identifying work projects, analyzing file usage patterns, etc. Python's data processing libraries like pandas can be very useful for this [11].
4. Output Generation: Generate output in the desired format (CSV, JSON, etc.). Python provides the csv and json modules for this purpose [18] [19].
5. Periodic Execution: To run the script periodically, you can use task scheduling tools. On MacOS, you can use launchd or cron [1].
6. Learning and Updating Rules: For the script to learn or accept new rules, you could implement a rule-based system where rules are stored in a file or database. The script could read these rules at each run and apply them accordingly.
Here's a basic Python script that demonstrates some of these steps:
import os
import csv
import json
 
def inventory_files(root_dir, exclude_dirs):
   inventory = []
   for root, dirs, files in os.walk(root_dir):
       dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in exclude_dirs]
       for file in files:
           path = os.path.join(root, file)
           size = os.path.getsize(path)
           inventory.append({"path": path, "size": size})
   return inventory
 
def write_to_csv(inventory, csv_file):
   with open(csv_file, 'w', newline='') as f:
       writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=["path", "size"])
       writer.writeheader()
       writer.writerows(inventory)
 
def write_to_json(inventory, json_file):
   with open(json_file, 'w') as f:
       json.dump(inventory, f, indent=4)
 
root_dir = "/path/to/your/home/folder"
exclude_dirs = ["node_modules", "another_folder_to_exclude"]
inventory = inventory_files(root_dir, exclude_dirs)
write_to_csv(inventory, "inventory.csv")
write_to_json(inventory, "inventory.json")
This script creates an inventory of all files in the specified root_dir, excluding any directories listed in exclude_dirs. It then writes this inventory to a CSV file and a JSON file. You can modify and expand this script according to your specific needs. Please replace "/path/to/your/home/folder" with the actual path of your home folder.
Remember, this is a simplified example and might not cover all your needs. For instance, it doesn't include the periodic execution, advanced metadata extraction, or rule-based system. You might need to incorporate additional Python libraries or even other tools or languages to fully meet your requirements. Always test scripts like these in a safe and reversible manner to ensure they behave as expected [14] [37].
